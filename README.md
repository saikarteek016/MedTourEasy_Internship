# MedTourEasy_Internship
Project Summary:

The project involved the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Collected and thoroughly preprocessed the dataset, employing data cleaning, handling missing values through data imputation, and applying various data enhancement techniques using the Pandas library. This ensured that the dataset was clean and suitable for analysis.

Dataset Splitting: To facilitate model training and testing, we utilized the Scikit-learn library to split the dataset into training and testing subsets. This step was crucial in evaluating our model's ability to generalize effectively.

Automated Model Selection: We leveraged TPOT, an automated machine learning tool, to select the most efficient predictive model. TPOT assisted in identifying the optimal model architecture and hyperparameters to maximize predictive accuracy.

Model Training: With the selected model in place, we proceeded to train it using the preprocessed dataset. This allowed our model to learn the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

Model Evaluation: We evaluated our model's performance using the AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) score, a robust metric for assessing classification models. The AUC score provided a comprehensive measure of our model's ability to predict blood donation outcomes effectively.

This GitHub repository contains comprehensive documentation of our collaborative efforts, including code, data, and results, in building a predictive model for blood donation prediction.
